# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 




### Start the Environment

Run the next code cell to install a few packages.  This line will take a few minutes to run!


```python
!pip -q install ./python
```

```python
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
import numpy as np
```

The environment is already saved in the Workspace and can be accessed at the file path provided below.  Please run the next code cell without making any changes.


```python
# please do not modify the line below
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="/data/Banana_Linux_NoVis/Banana.x86_64")
```

Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. Here we check for the first brain available, and set it as the default brain we will be controlling from Python.


```python
# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]
```

### Examine the State and Action Spaces

Run the code cell below to print some information about the environment.


```python
# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents in the environment
print('Number of agents:', len(env_info.agents))

# number of actions
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size
print('Number of actions:', action_size)

# examine the state space
state = env_info.vector_observations[0]
print('States look like:', state)
state_size = len(state)
print('States have length:', state_size)

# close the environment
```python
env.close()
```
